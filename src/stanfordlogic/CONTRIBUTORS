This code was developed by the Stanford Logic Group, which is headed by Michael
Genesereth, Associate Professor of Computer Science.

The majority of this code was written by David C. Haley <david@the-haleys.org>,
with significant contributions made by Eric Schkufza <eschkufz@stanford.edu>.
Where marked, some portions of this code are based loosely on the Camembert
game player written by David Haley and Pierre-Yves Laligand in Spring 2006 for
the Stanford University course on General Game Playing, CS 227b.
