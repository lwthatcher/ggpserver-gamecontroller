STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY ("STANFORD"), a body having corporate powers under
the laws of the State of California, and yourself (the "LICENSEE"). By
downloading, installing, executing, or otherwise using the software described
below, you accept all terms of this license. If you do not agree to all the
terms in this license, you may not download, install, execute, or otherwise use
the software described below.

Effective as of the date of download ("Effective Date"), STANFORD and LICENSEE
agree as follows:

    provided to LICENSEE pursuant to this Agreement.

3. GRANT

    3.1 STANFORD hereby grants and LICENSEE hereby accepts a worldwide,
    nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, and sublicense the
    SOFTWARE. The license shall continue in perpetuity unless terminated in
    accordance with Article 7.

        (a) Maintain the quality of the SOFTWARE;

        (b) Affix an appropriate notice of copyright ("(c) <year, e.g. 2007>
        The Board of Trustees of the Leland STANFORD Junior University") to all
        copies of the SOFTWARE.

        (c) Exercise due care in protecting the SOFTWARE from unauthorized
        disclosure to third parties, at least to the degree LICENSEE exercises
        care in protecting its own proprietary information; and

        (d) To take appropriate action with its employees, consultants, and
        sublicensees to satisfy its obligation under this Agreement with
        respect to maintaining the above degree of protection for SOFTWARE.

        However, LICENSEE shall have no confidentiality obligations with
        respect to any information if the same or similar information is or
        becomes within the public domain through no act of LICENSEE in breach
        of this Agreement, is independently developed by LICENSEE, or is
        received unrestricted from another source who who has legitimate access
        to the SOFTWARE and is not under an obligation of confidentiality to
        STANFORD

    3.3 LICENSEE agrees the source code is for internal use only and that when
    sublicensing only object code in binary form will be distributed.
    Notwithstanding for the foregoing to the contrary, if STANFORD is no longer
    making the SOFTWARE and/or compatible updated versions available on similar
    terms as those hereunder, LICENSEE may place the SOFTWARE in escrow with a
    bona-fide escrow service upon written notice to STANFORD, or, upon prior
    written permission from STANFORD, LICENSEE may distribute source code to
    third parties on a royalty-free, non-exclusive basis.

    3.4 STANFORD reserves the following rights:

        (a) To use, copy, and modify the SOFTWARE;

        (b) To distribute the SOFTWARE to third parties;

        (c) To use SOFTWARE for its own bona fide research, including sponsored
        research and collaborations; and

        (d) To publish any information included in SOFTWARE.

4. CONSIDERATION

    In consideration of the rights granted herein, LICENSEE shall report to
    STANFORD any bugs or errors in the SOFTWARE code which it may discover from
    time-to-time. Notice of any bug or error in the SOFTWARE shall be delivered
