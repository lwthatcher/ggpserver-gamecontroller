/**
 * The point of this interfaces is not to refer to the actual Player
 * implementation, only to PlayerInfos. This makes Matches that are not intended
 * to be run (e.g., finished or aborted matches) much more lightweight and
 * removes actual implementation details from these matches, because they do not
 * even need to know about reasoners.<br>
 * 
 * If you need a match that provides Player implementations instead of only
 * PlayerInfos, use RunnableMatchInterface.
